Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a person, system, or entity trying to access a particular resource, system, or service. It is a fundamental concept in computer security and is used to ensure that only authorized individuals or entities are granted access to protected resources, such as computer systems, databases, websites, or physical locations. Authentication serves to answer the question: "Who are you?"

Key aspects of authentication include:

1. **Identification:** The user or entity provides an identifier, such as a username, email address, or digital certificate, to establish their identity. This identifier is often unique and linked to their account or profile.

2. **Verification:** The system or service compares the provided identifier with a known database of authorized users or entities to determine if the claimed identity is valid.

3. **Authentication Factors:** Authentication can be based on one or more factors, including:
   - **Knowledge Factors:** Something the user knows, such as a password or PIN.
   - **Possession Factors:** Something the user possesses, such as a physical access card, a smartphone, or a security token.
   - **Biometric Factors:** Something related to the user's physical characteristics, like fingerprints, facial recognition, or retina scans.

4. **Authentication Methods:** The process of verifying identity can be achieved using various methods, including single-factor (one factor), two-factor (2FA), or multi-factor authentication (MFA).

5. **Challenges:** Authentication systems must address challenges like security (to prevent unauthorized access), usability (to ensure legitimate users can access resources easily), and resistance to fraud or hacking.

Authentication is a critical component of security in various domains, including online services, financial transactions, healthcare, government systems, and physical access control. It helps protect sensitive information, maintain privacy, and ensure the integrity of systems and data.

Common examples of authentication include logging into a computer or website using a username and password, using a fingerprint or face scan to unlock a smartphone, or presenting an access card to enter a secure building. In each case, the goal is to verify the identity of the user or entity to permit or deny access accordingly.
